This repo is a toy project that is friendly to beginners.<br>
CIFAR10 is a easy dataset to start-off the exploration in the world of Computer vision and deep learning.  <br>
Both the .py file and jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) contain similar contents with rich comments. <br>
No GPU (cuda support) needed, can be runed entirely with CPU.
